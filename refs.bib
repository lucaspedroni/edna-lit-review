abstract = {The mosquito midgut is a hostile environment that vector-borne parasites must survive to be transmitted. Commensal bacteria in the midgut can reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease, either by having direct anti-parasite effects or by stimulating basal immune responses of the insect host. As different bacteria have different effects on parasite development, the composition of the bacterial community in the mosquito gut is likely to affect the probability of disease transmission. We investigated the diversity of mosquito gut bacteria in the field using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to build up a comprehensive picture of the diversity of gut bacteria in eight mosquito species in this population. We found that mosquito gut typically has a very simple gut microbiota that is dominated by a single bacterial taxon. Although different mosquito species share remarkably similar gut bacteria, individuals in a population are extremely variable and can have little overlap in the bacterial taxa present in their guts. This may be an important factor in causing differences in disease transmission rates within mosquito populations.},

The analysis of environmental DNA through the use of specific gene markers such as species-specific DNA barcodes has been a key application of next-generation sequencing technologies in ecological and environmental research. Access to parallel, massive amounts of sequencing data, as well as subsequent improvements in read length and throughput of different sequencing platforms, is leading to a better representation of sample diversity at a reasonable cost. New technologies are being developed rapidly and have the potential to dramatically accelerate ecological and environmental research. The fast pace of development and improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies can reflect on broader and more robust applications in environmental DNA research. Here, we review the advantages and limitations of current next-generation sequencing technologies in regard to their application for environmental DNA analysis.},

abstract = {Direct isolation of nucleic acids from the environment may be useful in several respects, including the estimation of total biomass, detection of specific organisms and genes, estimations of species diversity, and cloning applications. We have developed a method that facilitates the concentration of microorganisms from aquatic samples and the extraction of their nucleic acids. Natural water samples of 350 to greater than 1,000 ml are concentrated on a single cylindrical filter membrane (type SVGS01015; Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.), and cell lysis and proteolysis are carried out within the filter housing. Crude, high-molecular-weight nucleic acid solutions are then drawn off the filter. These solutions can be immediately analyzed, concentrated, or purified, depending on the intended application. The method is simple, rapid, and economical and provides high-molecular-weight chromosomal DNA, plasmid DNA, and speciated RNAs which comigrate with 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNAs. The methods presented here should prove useful in studying both the ecology and the phylogeny of microbes that resist classical culture methods.},

Although certain algal isolates and higher plants contain conserved nucleotide sequences in the large subunit of the gene (rbcL) for this enzyme, such genes from natural microbial assemblages have not been heretofore examined. Using oligonucleotide primers designed for conserved regions of the rbcL gene of a Synechococcus sp. (Anacystis nidulans), we have amplified rbcL from DNA preparations from planktonic samples from a Florida reservoir and from algal isolates by the polymerase chain reaction. We have also detected rbcL by gene amplification in the extracellular DNA fraction of this reservoir, indicating that phytoplankton can be a source of dissolved DNA. These results suggest that gene amplification can be applied for the detection of conserved genes encoding enzymes involved in important ecological functions in aquatic environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Eukaryotes are ubiquitous in natural environments such as soil and freshwater. Little is known of their presence in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) or of the environmental conditions that affect their activity and survival. METHODS Eukaryotes were characterized by Illumina high-throughput sequencing targeting 18S rRNA gene (DNA) that estimates the total community and the 18S rRNA gene transcript (RNA) that is more representative of the active part of the community. DWDS cold water (N = 124), hot water (N = 40), and biofilm (N = 16) samples were collected from four cities in Finland. The sampled DWDSs were from two waterworks A-B with non-disinfected, recharged groundwater as source water and from three waterworks utilizing chlorinated water (two DWDSs of surface waterworks C-D and one of ground waterworks E). In each DWDS, samples were collected from three locations during four seasons of 1 year. RESULTS A beta-diversity analysis revealed that the main driver shaping the eukaryotic communities was the DWDS (A-E) (R = 0.73, P {\textless} 0.001, ANOSIM). The kingdoms Chloroplastida (green plants and algae), Metazoa (animals: rotifers, nematodes), Fungi (e.g., Cryptomycota), Alveolata (ciliates, dinoflagellates), and Stramenopiles (algae Ochrophyta) were well represented and active-judging based on the rRNA gene transcripts-depending on the surrounding conditions. The unchlorinated cold water of systems (A-B) contained a higher estimated total number of taxa (Chao1, average 380-480) than chlorinated cold water in systems C-E (Chao1 ≤ 210). Within each DWDS, unique eukaryotic communities were identified at different locations as was the case also for cold water, hot water, and biofilms. A season did not have a consistent impact on the eukaryotic community among DWDSs. CONCLUSIONS This study comprehensively characterized the eukaryotic community members within the DWDS of well-maintained ground and surface waterworks providing good quality water. The study gives an indication that each DWDS houses a unique eukaryotic community, mainly dependent on the raw water source and water treatment processes in place at the corresponding waterworks. In particular, disinfection as well as hot water temperature seemed to represent a strong selection pressure that controlled the number of active eukaryotic species.},

Traditionally studies on the diet composition of insectivorous bats have been based on the morphological identification of prey remains, but the accuracy of the results has been hampered due to methodological limitations. Lately, the DNA metabarcoding and High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) techniques have changed the scene since they allows prey identification to the species level, ultimately giving more precision to the results. Nevertheless, the use of one single primer set to amplify faecal DNA produces biases in the assessed dietary composition. Three horseshoe bats overlap extensively in their distribution range in Europe: Rhinolophus euryale, R. hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum. In order to achieve the deepest insight on their prey list we combined two different primers. Results showed that the used primers were complementary at the order and species levels, only 22 out of 135 prey species being amplified by both. The most frequent prey of R. hipposideros belonged to Diptera and Lepidoptera, to Lepidoptera in R. euryale, and Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera in R. ferrumequinum. The three bats show significant resource partitioning, since their trophic niche overlap is not higher than 34{\%}. Our results confirm the importance of combining complementary primers to describe the diet of generalist insectivorous bats with amplicon metabarcoding techniques. Overall, each primer set showed a subset of the prey composition, with a small portion of the total prey being identified by both of them. Therefore, each primer presented a different picture of the niche overlap among the three horseshoe bats due to their taxonomic affinity.},

abstract = {The assessment of species distribution is a first critical phase of biodiversity studies and is necessary to many disciplines such as biogeography, conservation biology and ecology. However, several species are difficult to detect, especially during particular time periods or developmental stages, potentially biasing study outcomes. Here we present a novel approach, based on the limited persistence of DNA in the environment, to detect the presence of a species in fresh water. We used specific primers that amplify short mitochondrial DNA sequences to track the presence of a frog (Rana catesbeiana) in controlled environments and natural wetlands. A multi-sampling approach allowed for species detection in all environments where it was present, even at low densities. The reliability of the results was demonstrated by the identification of amplified DNA fragments, using traditional sequencing and parallel pyrosequencing techniques. As the environment can retain the molecular imprint of inhabiting species, our approach allows the reliable detection of secretive organisms in wetlands without direct observation. Combined with massive sequencing and the development of DNA barcodes that enable species identification, this approach opens new perspectives for the assessment of current biodiversity from environmental samples.},

abstract = {This study is the first to use a metagenomics approach to characterize the phylogeny and functional capacity of the canine gastrointestinal microbiome. Six healthy adult dogs were used in a crossover design and fed a low-fiber control diet (K9C) or one containing 7.5{\%} beet pulp (K9BP). Pooled fecal DNA samples from each treatment were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing, generating 503,280 (K9C) and 505,061 (K9BP) sequences. Dominant bacterial phyla included the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes, both of which comprised ∼35{\%} of all sequences, followed by Proteobacteria (13-15{\%}) and Fusobacteria (7-8{\%}). K9C had a greater percentage of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, whereas K9BP had greater proportions of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes. Archaea were not altered by diet and represented ∼1{\%} of all sequences. All archaea were members of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with methanogens being the most abundant and diverse. Three fungi phylotypes were present in K9C, but none in K9BP. Less than 0.4{\%} of sequences were of viral origin, with {\textgreater}99{\%} of them associated with bacteriophages. Primary functional categories were not significantly affected by diet and were associated with carbohydrates; protein metabolism; DNA metabolism; cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments; amino acids and derivatives; cell wall and capsule; and virulence. Hierarchical clustering of several gastrointestinal metagenomes demonstrated phylogenetic and metabolic similarity between dogs, humans and mice. More research is required to provide deeper coverage of the canine microbiome, evaluate effects of age, genetics or environment on its composition and activity, and identify its role in gastrointestinal disease.},

abstract = {Insectivory, or the consumption of insects and other arthropods, is a significant yet cryptic component of omnivorous primate diets. Here, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify arthropods from fecal DNA and assess variation in insectivory by closely-related sympatric primates. We identified arthropod prey taxa and tested the hypothesis that variation in insectivory facilitates niche differentiation and coexistence among closely-related species with high dietary overlap. We collected 233 fecal samples from redtail (Cercopithecus ascanius; n = 118) and blue monkeys (C. mitis; n = 115) and used a CO1 metabarcoding approach to identify arthropod DNA in each fecal sample. Arthropod DNA was detected in 99{\%} of samples (N = 223 samples), and a total of 68 families (15 orders) were identified. Redtails consumed arthropods from 54 families, of which 12 (21.8{\%}) were absent from blue monkey samples. Blue monkeys consumed arthropods from 56 families, of which 14 (24.6{\%}) were absent from redtail samples. For both species, {\textgreater}97{\%} of taxa present belonged to four orders (Araneae, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera). Redtail samples contained more Lepidoptera taxa (p{\textless}0.05), while blue monkey samples contained more Araneae (p{\textless}0.05). Blue monkeys consumed a greater diversity of arthropod taxa than redtail monkeys (p{\textless}0.05); however, the average number of arthropod families present per fecal sample was greater in the redtail monkey samples (p{\textless}0.05). These results indicate that while overlap exists in the arthropod portion of their diets, 20-25{\%} of taxa consumed are unique to each group. Our findings suggest that variation in arthropod intake may help decrease dietary niche overlap and hence facilitate coexistence of closely-related primate species.},
